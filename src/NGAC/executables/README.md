# Standalone executables for NGAC

This folder contains standalone executables for NGAC.

To run the executables, you need to have [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

To run the executables as a python package you also need a bash terminal.

## OS Support

So far, the executables only work on arch, debian based systems or macos. There is no real reason for this, it is just that the team working on this project uses these systems.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the executable
./better_start_ngac.sh
```
